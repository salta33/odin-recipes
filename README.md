# odin-recipes
HTML project will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes; It is part of HTML Foundation of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. I expect myself to learn how to write basic code in HTML such as boilerplate, head, paragraphs and headings, lists, links and images. I will also learn ethics of writing good commit messages. I will be able to grasp the idea of when to commit.
