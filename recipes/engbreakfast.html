    <h1>English Breakfast</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/english-breakfast.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>English breakfast is a dish that consists of a number of components such as back bacon, eggs, British sausage, baked beans, fried tomato, fried mushrooms, black pudding, and fried and toasted bread; however, these can vary depending on where you are in Great Britain.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, this dish also included things like bone marrow, pork crackling, and a huge pork chop, and baked beans were always homemade. Even though the eggs can be fried, scrambled or poached, the majority of the ingredients are fried; hence the dish is colloquially known as the fry-up.</p>
    <p>English breakfast is a staple breakfast dish that most Brits will eat for the weekend as a sort of comfort food, although it can also be eaten for any meal of the day. It is typically served with tea, but also coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.</p>
